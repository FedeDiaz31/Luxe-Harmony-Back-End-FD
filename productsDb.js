Its dual single-coil pickups are voiced to deliver classic Tele tone. A 4-way switch allows players to quickly select each pickup individually or both pickups in either series or parallel wiring. A push-pull pot on the tone control allows players to flip the pickups in and out of phase in switch positions 2 and 4. The Soft V-shaped maple neck has a silky-smooth satin finish and plays effortlessly thanks to the 9.5radius rosewood fingerboard and medium jumbo frets.

Also included is the pistonic output of the bass driver which does not give rise to harmonic distortions, even with the highest sound peaks. Some of these reasons are obvious in the KH 310.
